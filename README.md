### FYI
We, McGill University students as team of 2, started this summer project due to high intersests in tradings and programming.
We will be starting from the scratch as we do not have much knowledge to implement our desired codes, we will be self-educated and implements based on that.
Due to lack of time and hands, we would be focusing on the basic backend that controls and guaranties the accuracy of calculation and correct implementation
of indicators (MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands) to provide reliable expectations.
In addition to this, we also aim to have well structured DB that can possibly manage the data with push/pull.
By doing this project, we are looking forward to get deeper knowledge in the world of Quant with competitive trading world. As well as the usage where most of the trading websites requires the premium subscription to be able to control all the indicators as they wants to, we, as student, based on the research, there exist uncountable number of strategies to invest, but among those, we wanted to show that these 3 indicators can be enough to make constant profits without any fee regulation.
